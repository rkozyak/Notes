% Free Fall - Overview
\subsection{Overview}
Free fall occurs when an object falls unimpeded. Gravity accelerates the object toward the earth and the entire time it rises, and the entire tie it falls. \[a=g=9.8m/s^2\] 
	
Acceleration is always constant and toward the center of the earth and air resistance is ignored. 
	
% Free Fall - Symmetry in Free Fall
\subsection{Symmetry in Free Fall}
When something is throw upward and returns to the thrower, this is very symmetric. The object spends half its time traveling up and half traveling down. The velocity when it returns to the group is the opposite of the velocity it was thrown upward with. Acceleration is $9.8 m/s^2$ everywhere!
