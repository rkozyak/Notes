\subsection{Position vs Time Graphs}

Particles moving with no acceleration (constant velocity) have graphs of position vs time with one slope. The velocity is not changing since the slope is constant.
		
Position vs time graphs for particles moving constant acceleration look parabolic. The instantaneous slope is changing. In this graph it is increase and the particle is speeding up.
		
\subsection{Kinematics Equations}
If you are not worried about $x$, then use this formula: \[v=v_{\circ} +at\]
If you are not worried about $v$, then use this formula: \[\Delta x = v_o*t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\]
If you are not worried about $t$, then use this formula: \[v^2=v_\circ^2+2a(\Delta x)\]
