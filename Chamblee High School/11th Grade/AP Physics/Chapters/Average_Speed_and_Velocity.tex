% Average Speed and Velocity - Average Speed
\subsection{Average Speed}
Average speed describes how fast a particle is moving. Average speed is always a positive number. The equation for average speed is: \[s\textsubscript{ave} = \frac{d}{\Delta t}\] where: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $s\textsubscript{ave}$ = average speed
	\item $d$ = distance
	\item $\Delta t$ = elapsed time
\end{itemize}
The SI unit of speed is the $m/s$.

% Average Speed and Velocity - Average Velocity
\subsection{Average Velocity}
Average velocity describes how fast the displacement is changing. Average velocity can either be positive or negative depending on direction. The equation for average velocity is: \[v\textsubscript{ave} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\] where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $v\textsubscript{ave}$ = average speed
	\item $\Delta x$ = displacement
	\item $\Delta t$ = elapsed time
\end{itemize}
The SI unit of speed is the $m/s$.
	
% Average Speed and Velocity - Instantaneous Velocity
\subsection{Instantaneous Velocity}
Instantaneous Velocity is the velocity at a single instant in time. If the velocity is uniform, or constant, the instantaneous velocity is the same as the average velocity. If the velocity is not constant, then the instantaneous velocity is not the same as the average velocity, and we must carefully distinguish between the two.
