% Uniform Circular Motion
\section{Uniform Circular Motion}

% Overview
\subsection{Overview}
Uniform circular motion is the motion of an object traveling at a constant speed on a circular path. \[\mbox{The distance the object travels: } d=2\pi r\] \[\mbox{The speed of the object: } v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}\]

In uniform circular motion, the speed is constant but the velocity is not. The object is constantly changing directions so it is constantly acceleration. The acceleration is called centripetal acceleration. 

% Centripetal Acceleration
\subsection{Centripetal Acceleration}
Centripetal acceleration is always directed toward the center of the circle. \[a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}\]

% Centripetal Force
\subsection{Centripetal Force}
Centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the circle. This force is not a unique force but instead it must be provided by some other force. \[\sum F = \frac{mv^2}{r}\]

% Centrifugal Force
\subsection{Centrifugal Force}
This is the forbidden force. It is not a real force but instead it is the way we fell about centripetal force.
