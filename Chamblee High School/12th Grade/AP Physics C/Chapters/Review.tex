Mathematically velocity is referred to as the derivative of position with respect to time. Acceleration can also be referred to as the second derivative of position with respect to time.

\[a=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\]

\[x=At^n\]
\[v=\frac{dx}{dt}=nAt^{n-1}\]

% Kinematic Equation Review
\subsection{Kinematic Equation Review}
\[v=v_o+at\]
\[x=x_o+v_ot+\frac{1}{2}at^2\]
\[v^2=v^2_o+2a(\Delta x)\]
