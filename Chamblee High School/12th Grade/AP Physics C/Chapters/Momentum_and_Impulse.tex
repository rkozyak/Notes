% Momentum and Impulse
\section{Momentum and Impulse}

% Linear Momentum
\subsection{Linear Momentum}
The linear momentum of a particle is the product of its mass and velocity.
\[p=mv\]

A system has a linear momentum that ie equal to the vector sum of the momenta of the particles
\[P=\sum p_i\]
The linear momentum of a system is conserved unless the system experiences an external force.

% Impulse (J)
\subsection{Impulse (J)}
Impulse is the internal of force over a period of time
\[J=\int F dt\]
The change in momentum of the particle is equal to the impulse acting on it
\[\Delta p = J\]
\[dp=F dt\]


% Collisions
\subsection{Collisions}
Momentum is conserved so $P_\text{before}=P_\text{after}$. In elastic collisions, kinetic energy is also conserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is lost. In perfectly inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is still lost but the objects now stick together. In explosions, which is the reverse of perfectly inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is gained.
