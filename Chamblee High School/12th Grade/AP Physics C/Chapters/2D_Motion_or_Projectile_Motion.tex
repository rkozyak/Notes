\section{ 2D Motion or Projectile Motion}

% Projectile Motion
\subsection{Projectile Motion}
Can be 1, 2 or 3-Dimensional motion. Something is fired, thrown, shot or hurried near the earth's surface. Horizontal velocity is constant. Vertical velocity is accelerated. Air resistance is still ignored.

% Horizontal Component of Velocity
\subsection{Horizontal Component of Velocity}
is not accelerated\\
not included by gravity

% Vertical Component of Velocity 
\subsection{Vertical Component of Velocity }
accelerated by gravity
\[V_y=V_o-gt\]
